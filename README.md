First, thanks for a chance to try to get in traineeship and improve my skills


To see my project, download Forum.zip file and unpack it to any point in your PC, after this launch .sln file.

To launch program without errors follow next steps:
  - Open appsettings.json and enter your Connection Strings options (Server and Database)
  - Rebuild solution
  - Open terminal and enter this command " dotnet ef database update --context ContentDbContext " (other context, UserDbContext will update by themself, when you will launch program)
  - Press F5 and rate my web program

Have a nice day :)
